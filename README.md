<b>Website Editor Info</b>

<p>
This app is a prototype of a website editor, starting point of a more
complex project.
<br />
<br />
A powerful and intuitive tool for managing the layout of fully
responsive websites. This editor allows you to easily design and
customize your site through drag-and-drop functionality and
user-friendly buttons, simplifying the entire process. Everything is
draggable: you can move columns between different sections, shift
content between columns, and rearrange sections, columns, and individual
content effortlessly. In addition to managing layouts, you can add or
delete elements and customize various options, such as backgrounds,
borders, fonts, font sizes, and more. Whether you're building from
scratch or refining an existing design, the editor provides complete
control for creating a visually appealing and functional website.
<br />
<br />
This app is just a prototype, at the moment there is no connection with
a database, data saving is not supported.
<br />
<br />
<b>Some possible future updates</b>:
<br /><br /> - connection of the app with a database
<br /> - login to access the editor
<br /> - management of more contents
<br /> - more options for each content
<br /> - content product management
<br /> - page management
<br /> - and more
<br />
<br />
This app uses <b>Dnd-Kit</b> for drag and drop operations and{" "}
<b>quill</b> for text editor.
